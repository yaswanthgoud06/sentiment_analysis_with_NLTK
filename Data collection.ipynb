The film had a good start for about 20 minutes along with Senapathys entry but continues to go down hill after that.   The grandeur and production values are nice.

All the cameos expect Mrunal are wasted and Vijay Deverakondas cameo is very odd.   SaNA did a very good job with the BGM in certain places but in others it was just adequate.   Prabhas had limited screen time in this one but did a good job in a fun character and gives a big fan worthy sequence in the climax   The rest of the cast especially Amitabh and Deepika have done and take up majority of the screenspace.   #kalki2898AD #Kalki',\n",
