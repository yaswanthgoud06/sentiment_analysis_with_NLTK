"#Darling is a Rom-Com with no purpose or aim. The film tries to be light hearted and ends up providing a few laughs, but apart from that the film neither engages nor entertains. The comedy is artificial throughout which gives it a tedious feel. Nabha Natesh‚Äôs role irritates. Can easily skip this one!   Rating: 1.75/5"
#Darling Boring 1st Half!   The comedy is artificial and does not work at all so far. Storyline is very thin so far. Need a huge 2nd half to save this one.
Showtime: #Darling
"#Indian2 is an outdated and tedious movie. Though the movie tries to give honest messages, it‚Äôs done in a boring way with no proper emotion and drama at all.   Shankar tried to repeat the screenplay of his old movies but fails to recreate the magic big time. All of the emotions are completely artificial and feel like a serial drama. The film had a good start for about 20 minutes along with Senapathys entry but continues to go down hill after that.   The grandeur and production values are nice. Anirudh had no scope to give an impactful score. While you can atleast sit through the first half, the second half doesn‚Äôt give you that chance. Disaster! #Bharateeyudu2   Rating: 1.75/5"

Kamal Hassan is doing well. Grandeur and Production Values stand out in the first half. Anirudhs BGM is pretty ineffective so far.
#Indian2 Strictly Average 1st Half!   Film starts off well with building an emotional set-up but then goes down a predictable and routine path. So far reminds us of Shankars old screenplay structure but the routine screenplay style makes it less impactful. Needs a good 2nd half #Bharateeyudu2

"Kudos to the whole of team of Kalki for attempting to bring a never before movie for Indian Cinema.   Nag Ashwin showed signs of both brilliance and inexperience. He was brilliant in focusing on the visuals and the finer details world. However, it felt at times he couldn‚Äôt establish a proper drama and emotional connect which would‚Äôve elevated the movie even further.   All the cameos expect Mrunal are wasted and Vijay Deverakondas cameo is very odd.   SaNA did a very good job with the BGM in certain places but in others it was just adequate.   Prabhas had limited screen time in this one but did a good job in a fun character and gives a big fan worthy sequence in the climax   The rest of the cast especially Amitabh and Deepika have done and take up majority of the screenspace.   #kalki2898AD #Kalki"
"#Kalki2898AD is a larger than life Sci-FI Action Experience. The visuals and world building by Nag Ashwin are never before from Indian Cinema. However, Nag Ashwin shows some inexperience in building a proper drama and emotional connect with somewhat of a flat screenplay.   Still, he was able to manage a couple of very good blocks especially the climax which worked very well and is goosebumps worthy.   Despite some of its flaws, This is a movie that should be experienced on the big screen for the experience it offers!  Rating: 3/5"
Interval Block stands out the most from the 1st half üëç #Kalki2898AD
"#Kalki2898AD Passable 1st Half!  The visuals and set up is something that has not been seen from Indian cinema which is captivating along with an interesting storyline. However, the screenplay is done in a mostly flat way so far. Prabhas has a fun character but limited screen time so far. Seems like 1st half is just a set up."

#Indian2 Trailer makes very little impact. Reminiscent of movies that came over a decade ago and doesn‚Äôt offer much of a curiosity factor. Grandeur wise looks alright but the whole cut misses a much needed X-factor. Hopefully Shankar can deliver! #Bharateeyudu2
#KALKI2898AD‚Äå 2nd Trailer cut delivers again showing the visual spectacle world of Kalki in a grand manner. Gives a good glimpse into the drama/emotion that will unfold. Only gripe is the background music which is subpar and not effective at all but expecting SaNa to deliver in the movie. Raised curiosity levels!
"#Manamey is an inferior movie that tries to fall into the feel good family/love drama template. The 1st half is watchable with some light hearted comedy that somewhat works. However, the 2nd half goes on endlessly without any impactful scenes. The emotional connect needed for this genre is missing coupled with underwritten characterizations. Not up to the mark!   Rating: 2.25/5"
Showtime: #Manamey
"#GangsofGodavari is a below par rural gangster drama that had potential with its set up but falters in execution. The first half is watchable with a couple of good mass blocks. However, the screenplay is narrated with a choppy edit that fails to build a proper drama and emotion. The second half goes for a toss with nothing much to mention. Disappointing!   Rating: 2.25/5"
Showtime: #GangsofGodavari
#BujjiAndBhairava hints at a one of a kind futuristic set up that has not been seen from Indian cinema. These few episodes are more on the fun side but the massive ambition the team has is clearly seen. If the prelude vibe can be translated on the big screen then sky is the limit. This one definitely raises expectations üëç #Kalki2898AD
#LoveMe is a silly ghost themed loved story that had an interesting core idea but the execution is mostly bad. The director fails to create suspense apart from a few bits in both halves and the screenplay is unconvincing and confusing at times. Music is ineffective. Nothing much else to mention.   Rating: 1.75/5
Showtime: #LoveMe
"#Chamkila is a captivating biopic that leaves a lasting impact. Apart from a few flaws and some pacing issues, the narration of Amar Singh Chamkilas life is done in a mostly engaging way with Imtiaz Ali‚Äôs mark all over making you reflect on society. Diljit and Parineeti were excellent. Easily one of the better biopics to come from Indian Cinema. Go check it out on Netflix! #AmarSinghChamkila"
"#VarshangalkkuShesham is a drama full of soul and heartwarming moments throughout. It may not be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea and the runtime/slow paced  narration style is a problem at times but if you can get over that, it‚Äôs definitely a film that will take you on an emotional journey.   Vineeth Srinivasan has made another commendable film after Hridayam. Cinema fanatics will like this even more. Another praise worthy film from Malayalam Cinema!"
"#BadeMiyanChoteMiyan is a run-of-the-mill action film that is alright in parts but doesn‚Äôt offer anything new.   The film follows a beaten to death storyline of an antagonist being associated with Indian forces and getting betrayed thus seeking revenge.   The chemistry between Akshay and Tiger works well along with a few action blocks and Prithvirajs character.  However, the screenplay is predictable and doesn‚Äôt have a proper emotional connect and feels tiring after while as we‚Äôve seen the same structure in many movies. Overall, a so-so time-pass film that is mostly forgettable. #BMCM   Rating: 2.5/5"
#Pushpa2TheRule Teaser felt more like a glimpse but Allu Arjun‚Äôs avatar is absolutely BREATHTAKING!! Need a lot of guts to try a getup like that especially coming from Telugu Cinema. Wish they showed more content but definitely raises expectations and makes you look forward!
It is high time that VD steps out of his comfort zone and stops doing these monotonous template roles. His performance and character worked very well in GG but in this it feels repetitive and leaves no impact at all.   Parasuram tried to copy the same template structure of GG but fails in recreating the same magic. There is a scene in America where American girls think VD is a prostitute and start attacking him in the middle of Times Square in New York‚Ä¶ not sure what Parasuram was thinking when writing scenes like that.   #FamilyStar
#FamilyStar is an inferior template rom-com family movie that has a few time-pass moments but no real emotional connection nor feel good moments.   First half is underwhelming and feels like a serial until the pre-interval. Second half starts on a more fun note but quickly turns uninteresting and preachy. Music is very ineffective. The blockbuster combo of GG disappoints. Below Par!    Rating: 2.25/5
#FamilyStar Below Par 1st Half!   So far it has a slow serial like feel to it. Few moments are entertaining but has absolutely nothing new or noteworthy yet. Need a big 2nd half!
Showtime: #FamilyStar

"#TilluSquare A Decent Entertainer that has fun moments throughout. Tillu‚Äôs characterization and one liners have worked well again in this one along with a few fun twists. While some of the comedy lands well, some of it feels repetitive and mundane at times. Nevertheless, a pretty lighthearted entertaining watch!   Rating: 2.75-3/5"
#TilluSquare Decent 1st Half!  Siddhu is back again with his trademark energetic avatar and one liners that are carrying the film. Comedy works in parts so far but feels redundant at times . Fun interval twist sets up the 2nd half well.
Showtime: #TilluSquare
"#OmBheemBush is a passable comedy entertainer that is filled with contemporary references. Film runs solely on the trio, comic one liners, and a few hilarious blocks which work well. However, the storyline is almost non-existent which gives a lengthy feel to it and the film goes overboard in some places coupled with below par music. Leave aside logics and you can give this mindless comedy entertainer a try!   Rating: 2.75/5"
Showtime: #OmBheemBush
"#Premalu is a Breezy Rom-Com that is enjoyable throughout. It has a cliched feel to it and feels slightly dragged at times, but the lighthearted nature of the film keeps it entertaining from start to finish. Targeted towards the younger audience but can be watched with families as well. Fun watch!   Rating: 3/5"
"#ManjummelBoys A Heartwarming Survival Thriller that takes time to get going but once it does it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Though there is a predictability factor, the narration keeps you engaged. Performances are outstanding. Good Watch!"

"#OperationValentine An Aerial Action Film that is narrated in a dull way where the drama does not work much and lacks an emotional high needed for a genre like this. While the attempt is commendable and there are a few satisfying moments, most of it is lifeless coupled with inferior VFX.   Rating: 2.25/5"
"#OoruPeruBhairavaKona A Subpar Fantasy Thriller that only works in a few parts!   The first half holds interest with a unique concept despite a dull narration style. However, the second half goes off-track after a while and into a predictable mode. Pre-Interval sequence stands out.   The curiosity that was built during the initial portions goes for a toss during the payoff scenes as the director tried a comic approach in serious situations which didn‚Äôt work well. Music is nice. Editing and the sluggish narration are the biggest drawbacks.   Rating: 2.25-2.5/5"
Showtime: #OoruPeruBhairavaKona
"#Animal North America Closing Reported Gross [Final]:  $15,001,042 - 739 Locations [‚Çπ124.51 Crores]  One of the biggest blockbusters of Indian Cinema!! 3rd Highest Hindi Grosser of All-Time in North America. All-Time Record in Canada."
"#Eagle An Ordinary Action Thriller with a below average 1st half but a better 2nd half which saves the film to an extent!   The action sequences in the 2nd half are the biggest USP for the film and have a come out well. Production Values and Cinematography stand out.  Director drew heavy inspiration from the style of Vikram and also a bit of KGF. What works in those movies, does not work much in this one because of the tiresome narration. BGM could‚Äôve been better. Most dialogues feel like quotes thus evoke no emotion and get rather irritating.   Action scenes and the climax portions work but the rest is so-so.  Rating: 2.5/5"
#Eagle Below Average 1st half!  Interesting storyline being narrated in a tiresome way. Ravi Teja has limited screen time so far. Production Values are good.
Showtime: #Eagle
#AmbajipetaMarriageBand A Predictable and Bland Village Drama that deals with a upper/lower class storyline. Director tried to tell this story in a honest way but the formulaic approach reminds us of many movies thus lacks moments that feel truly hard hitting or emotional. Good performances by the main leads stand out. A time pass OTT watch at best!   Rating: 2.25/5
#AmbajipetaMarriageBand Average 1st Half!  Engaging initial start but goes down the path of a template village drama that is predictable and bland. Good performances are holding the film together so far.
Showtime: #AmbajipetaMarriageBand
"#Saindhav A Stylish Action Drama with standout action sequences but the drama part falls flat!   The film has its heart in the right place but the narration is done in a flat way where there are very little highs and even when there is potential the music fails big time. SaNa‚Äôs BGM is the weakest part of the film and has lowered the impact of many scenes.  Few action sequences, good climax, and Venky‚Äôs performance in an action avatar standout but the rest is mediocre.   Rating: 2.5/5"
"#Saindhav Decent 1st Half!   First 30mins runs on a slow note but picks up after with an interesting storyline, good action sequences and performances. BGM had scope to be a lot better and is quite ineffective till now."
Showtime: #Saindhav
This movie will be a textbook on how to use  VFX with a limited budget and will inspire makers with smaller budget. Kudos to Director Prashanth Varma and the Producers for pulling off a subject like this. Teja Sajja has performed well and definitely has a bright future #Hanuman
"#Hanuman A Well Made Superhero Story told with the element of Hanuman infused!   While the 1st half is engaging throughout, the 2nd half feels a little dragged at parts but the climax more than makes up for it. Very rare do we see a concept like this and the director has succeeded in pulling off a story like for the most part. BGM is good. Production Values and the VFX standout. Good Watch üëç  Rating: 3/5"
#Hanuman Good 1st Half!  Director is doing a good job of mixing a superhero story with a Hanuman element while keeping commercial elements in tact. VFX is great.
Showtime: #Hanuman
